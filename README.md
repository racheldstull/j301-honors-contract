<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This site is a compilation of research on traditional Japanese architecture. From the home screen, you can navigate to a brief overview of what this site entails and a short synopsis of Japanese history. From there, you can navigate to read more in depth about the history of Japan, and its important historical periods, as they are often mentioned in the remaining text. You can also choose to just dive into some of the elements and structures that are important in traditional Japanese architecture. You can read about the history and cultural significance of tatami mats, discover the religious symbolism of the famous torii gates, or dive into the various styles of roofs and their importance.
