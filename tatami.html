                <p><i>Tatami</i> (畳) is a soft mat floor covering which are used in traditional Japanese style rooms and dojo. They can also be seen in places and rooms such as inns, restaurants, temples, and tea houses.</p>
                <p>When entering a tatami room, it is custom to remove shoes and slippers to prevent damage to the mats.</p>
                <h4>&mdash; Construction</h4>
                <p>They are shaped like a 2:1 rectangle. Generally, <i>tatami</i> dimensions are about 91 cm x 182 cm x 5 cm, but the sizing may vary by geographical region of Japan, and/or type of room it is in.</p>
                <p>The core, <i>tatami-doko</i> (畳床), traditionally was made from rice straw, but nowadays it is typically made from compressed wood-chip boards or polystyrene foam. The change is a result of a reduced supply of rice straw and concerns of mite and mold infestations.</p>
                <p>Over the core, <i>tatami-omote</i> (畳表), is the tightly woven grass covering called <i>igusa</i> (藺草). Although not required of all <i>tatami</i>, they are often constructed with a cloth border, <i>tatami-heri</i> (畳縁) on all sides.</p>
                <p>In the average home, the cloth of the <i>tatami-heri</i> is black, navy blue, or brown, while in temples and mansions, they are made with colorful silk. They are woven to create a figured patterns. Often, gold and silver are included in the designs.</p>
                <h4>&mdash; History</h4>
                <p><i>Tatami</i> didn't come about until Heian period, and they were far different from today's <i>tatami</i> as they were simple cushions, sleeping mats, and straw mats for sitting on.</p>
                <p>The word <i>tatami</i> is derived from <i>tatamu</i> (畳む), meaning to fold or pile. This is because the earliest <i>tatami</i> were folded and stored away when not in use.</p>
                <p>During the Heian period when <i>tatami</i> were created, they were a luxury used by only the most influential aristocrats. In their residences, the floors were mostly wooden, and the <i>tatami</i> would be taken out for use. The lower classes only had simple straw mats to cover the dirt flooring of their homes.</p>
                <p>During the Kamakura period, <i>tatami</i> began to be laid out over small rooms. Although it was still considered a luxury item that commoners could not get a hold of, high ranking samurai and priests began to use them in their own homes.</p>
                <p>The Muromachi period marked the rise of the mats being laid out closely together to cover entire rooms. Rooms that were completely spread with <i>tatami</i> began to be known as <i>zashiki</i> (座敷). The mats themselves were called <i>shikidatami</i> (敷畳), to contrast the single mats called <i>okidatami</i> (置畳), meaning "single mat-like cushion".</p>
                <p>For sleeping purposes, the mats used by nobility and high ranking samurai were called <i>goza</i> (茣蓙), while common classes used simple straw mats or loose straw to sleep on.</p>
