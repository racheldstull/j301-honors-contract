            </div>
            <div class="content-bar">
                <p><i>Tatami</i> (畳) is a soft mat floor covering which is used in traditional Japanese style rooms and dojo. They can also be seen in places and rooms such as inns, restaurants, temples, and tea houses.</p>
                <p>When entering a tatami room, it is custom to remove shoes and slippers to prevent damage to the mats.</p>
                <h4>&mdash; Construction</h4>
                <p>They are shaped like a 2:1 rectangle. Generally, <i>tatami</i> dimensions are about 91 cm x 182 cm x 5 cm, but the sizing may vary by geographical region of Japan, and type of room it is in.</p>
                <p>The core, <i>tatami-doko</i> (畳床), traditionally was made from rice straw, but nowadays, it is typically made from compressed wood-chip boards or polystyrene foam. The change is a result of a reduced supply of rice straw and concerns of mite and mold infestations.</p>
                <p>Over the core, <i>tatami-omote</i> (畳表), is the tightly woven grass covering called <i>igusa</i> (藺草). Although not required of all <i>tatami</i>, they are often constructed with a cloth border, <i>tatami-heri</i> (畳縁) on all sides.</p>
                <p>In the average home, the cloth of the <i>tatami-heri</i> is black, navy blue, or brown, while in temples and mansions, they are made with colorful silk. They are woven to create figured patterns. Often, gold and silver are included in the designs.</p>
                <h4>&mdash; History</h4>
                <p><i>Tatami</i> didn't come about until the Heian period, and they were far different from today's <i>tatami</i> as they were simple cushions, sleeping mats, and straw mats for sitting on.</p>
                <p>The word <i>tatami</i> is derived from <i>tatamu</i> (畳む), meaning to fold or pile. This is because the earliest <i>tatami</i> was folded and stored away when not in use.</p>
                <p>During the Heian period, when <i>tatami</i> was created, they were a luxury used by only the most influential aristocrats. In their residences, the floors were mostly wooden, and the <i>tatami</i> would be taken out for use. The lower classes only had simple straw mats to cover the dirt flooring of their homes.</p>
                <p>During the Kamakura period, <i>tatami</i> began to be laid out over small rooms. Although it was still considered a luxury item that commoners could not get a hold of, high ranking samurai and priests began to use them in their own homes.</p>
                <p>The Muromachi period marked the rise of the mats being laid out closely together to cover entire rooms. Rooms that were completely spread with <i>tatami</i> began to be known as <i>zashiki</i> (座敷). The mats themselves were called <i>shikidatami</i> (敷畳), to contrast the single mats called <i>okidatami</i> (置畳), meaning "single mat-like cushion."</p>
                <p>One could quickly recognize someone's social status based on the thickness of their <i>okidatami</i>, as well as the colors and patterns of the <i>tatami-heri.</i></p>
                <p>For sleeping purposes, the mats used by nobility and high ranking samurai were called <i>goza</i> (茣蓙), while common classes used simple straw mats or loose straw to sleep on.</p>
                <p><i>Tatami</i> began to reach the common population around the end of the 17th century, during the mid-Edo period. Usage grew, and eventually it became standard in farming houses during the Meiji period. <i>Tatami</i> were standard in just about every house until after WWII, when westernization grew rapidly.</p>
                <p>Today, homes have very few <i>tatami</i> floors, although it is not uncommon for a home to have a single room with <i>tatami</i> flooring. These rooms are now called <i>washitsu</i>.</p>
                <h4>&mdash; Size by Region</h4>
                <p>Because <i>tatami</i> are created in standard sizes, it is common for square-footage of a house to be measured in number of <i>tatami</i> mats.</p>
                <p>Ones made in Kyoto are called <i>kyoumadatami</i> (京間畳), and are sized as follows: 95.5 cm x 191 cm.</p>
                <p>Ones made in Nagoya are called <i>ainomadatami</i> (合の間畳), and are sized as follows: 91 cm x 182 cm.</p>
                <p>Ones made on Tokyo are called <i>edomadatami</i> (江戸間畳) or <i>kantomadatami</i> (関東間畳), and are sized as follows: 88 cm x 176 cm</p>
                <p>Ones used in the countryside are called <i>inakadatami</i> (田舎畳), are the same size as ones made in Tokyo.</p>
                <h4>&mdash; Layout</h4>
                <p>There are rules for how to lay down <i>tatami</i>.</p>
                <p>The are two main ways that they can be laid down: in <i>shūgijiki</i> (祝儀敷き) or in <i>fushūgijiki</i> (不祝儀敷き).</p>
                <p><i>Shūgijiki</i> are arranged to create 'T's, while <i>fushūgijiki</i> are arranged to create '+'s. Nowadays, <i>fushūgijiki</i> is thought to bring bad luck, so <i>shūgijiki</i> is primarily used.</p>
                <h4>&mdash; In Teahouses</h4>
                <p><i>Tatami</i> in <i>chashitsu</i> (茶室) have special names. The mat that the host sits on is called <i>shudatami</i> (主畳), <i>temaedatami</i> (点前畳), or <i>dougudatami</i> (道具畳). The <i>tatami</i> from where the host enters is called <i>fumikomidatami</i> (踏込畳). If a guest is a nobleman, the mat they sit on is called <i>kinindatami</i> (貴人畳). If the guest is ordinary, the mat they sit on is called <i>kyakudatami</i> (客畳). The mat where the <a href="irori.html">irori</a> is located is called <i>rodatami</i> (炉畳).</p>
